1.Definitions

A." Inschain Platform" is a website maintained by INSCHAIN providing an electronic interface to reference and compare "Insurance Product Information" (defined below) available in Hong Kong.

6.Service Level

A. INSCHAIN commits to provisioning Licensee with the proper access to the licensed materials. The performance metric(s) set forth in this section form the Service Level that INSCHAIN agrees to meet in the delivery of Inschain.

B.Service level agreement for product updates

I.Upon any changes or updates of insurance product information (including product features and relevant premium information), INSCHAIN will strive to update the relevant product features and premium rates within the following time periods:

1.Level 1 priority products: 10 business days.

A.Defined as the top 16 products as defined by Licensee. Licensee may change the list of products on a quarterly basis; reasonable requests for off-cycle product additions and/or line-up changes will also be considered by INSCHAIN.

2.Level 2 core products: 30 business days.

A.Level 2 core products currently includes all other products currently supported by the Inschain platform as at the time this Agreement was signed.

Ii.The service level for updating products is subject to the following limitations:

The update timelines are triggered based on when product changes are brought to INSCHAIN’s attention. As insurance companies do not always notify the Licensee and/or INSCHAIN of product changes, and relevant materials may not be updated consistently for Inschain’s monitoring mechanisms to be properly triggered (e.g. time lags in changes to publicly available material or insurance company quotation systems for brokers), there may be delays between when a product change is effective and when INSCHAIN is made aware of them. INSCHAIN will take proactive measures to reduce such time lags.
The above timeline is predicated upon INSCHAIN having the proper and expedient access to information needed to make the relevant updates. Any delays in accessing the updated information may lead to subsequent delays in updating the licensed materials.
Insurance companies may make changes that are more complex than INSCHAIN currently anticipates, or may require further clarification from the relevant parties. In such a scenario the updates will be made on a best efforts basis, with progress regularly communicated to Licensee.
Service support scope and management
Effective support of Inschain is a result of maintaining consistent service levels. The following points provide relevant details on service availability, monitoring of in-scope services and related components.
Licensee should appoint single contact person to gather Licensee’s support needs and communicate to INSCHAIN via the support services. INSCHAIN will not be responsible for directly handling the requests from Licensee’s individual users.
