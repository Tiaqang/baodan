• PURPOSE AND USAGE OF TOKENS
    GETX is a cryptographic utility token. The purpose of GETX is to facilitate the participation in the insChain platform (the insChain Platform) which, when fully developed, is envisaged to be ablockchain infrastructure-neutral customisable integrated insurance platform based on scalable blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies which enables the application layer of insurance functions, allowing policyholders, platform administrators, third- party actuaries, and token holders to interact on a transparent and pre-defined basis. The insChain Platform is not, and will in no case be, an enterprise, corporation, partnership or other entity  or body corporate established under the laws of any jurisdiction, but a computerized consensus protocol based on which a public transaction ledger is generated.

    GETX is designed to be the only mechanism by which a user may obtain access to certain services and products provided in the ecosystem, on the insChain Platform (when the same is completed and deployed), and further, GETX is to be paid to users as incentives for contributing and maintaining the insChain Platform. For each exchange of services or products on the insChain Platform, the costs are to be quantified in GETX and paid to the insChain Platform and/or the other party providing the service. The following features are planned for GETX: (i) for agents, GETX may be used to purchase insurance services such as intelligent underwriting, intelligent claiming; (ii) for policyholders, GETX may be used to purchase P2P insurance and insurance services such as intelligent underwriting, intelligent life settlements, and (iii) for insurers, GETX may be used to purchase services such as intelligent underwriting, compliance and regulatory and intelligent claiming.

    GETX is an integral and indispensable part of the insChain Platform because in the absence of GETX, there would be no common unit of exchange for goods and services or to incentivise users to contribute and maintain the platform, thus rendering the ecosystem on the insChain Platform unsustainable. The ownership of GETX carries no rights, express or implied, in the Seller, its related entitles or its affiliates (each, a Group Entity) other than the right to use GETX as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the insChain Platform, upon the successful development and deployment of the insChain Platform. GETX is sold as a consumable virtual good, and does not have any functionality or utility outside the ecosystem on the insChain Platform – accordingly it is not necessarily merchantable and does not necessarily have any other use or value. The ecosystem on the insChain Platform is structured as a "closed system" insofar as the usage of GETX is concerned.

    You understand and accept that GETX:
    • is not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction;
    • does not represent or confer on you any ownership right, shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest of any form with respect to any Group Entity or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, or any of their revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the insChain Platform, any Group Entity and/or any service provider of any Group Entity;
    • is not intended to be a representation of currency or money (whether fiat or virtual or any form of electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;    • is not a loan to any Group Entity and is not intended to represent a debt owed by any Group Entity, and there shall be no expectation of profit or interest income arising in connection therewith;

        • may only be utilised on the insChain Platform, is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by any Group Entity;
        • does not provide you with any ownership or other interest in any Group Entity;
        • is not any form of financial derivative, commercial paper or negotiable instrument;
        • will not entitle token holders to any promise of fees, revenue, profits or investment returns, nor should there be any such expectation;
        • is not any note, debenture, warrant or other certificate that entitles the holder to any interest, dividend or any kind of return from any Group Entity or any person;
        • is not any commodity or asset that any person is obliged to redeem or purchase;
        • is not for speculative investment;
        • does not result in any mutual covenants, or agreement to rights and obligations, being entered into between you and other holders of GETX inter se; and
        • is subject to limitations and conditions in these Terms and all applicable policies as may be published from time to time on the insChain Platform.
You acknowledge and agree that no Group entity is under any obligation to issue replacement GETX in the event any GETX or private key is lost, stolen, malfunctioning, destroyed or otherwise inaccessible or unusable for any reason.

IN PARTICULAR, PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERTAKING LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF GETX. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, THERE MAY BE CHANGES TO THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF GETX IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH WE ARE OR GETX IS SUBJECT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CHANGES TO THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF GETX, THE DETAILS OF THE CHANGES SHALL BE PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR ANY SUCH NOTICES.

• SCOPE OF TERMS

    Unless otherwise stated herein, your purchase of GETX (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), and continued holding and/or usage of GETX is governed solely by these Terms. New terms or policies may be published from time to time on the insChain Platform at our sole discretion.

    The sale of GETX does not constitute the provision of any goods and/or services as at the date that these Terms form a binding agreement between the Parties. Any potential future usage of GETX in connection with providing or receiving services or the usage of the insChain Platform (when the same is completed and deployed) will be governed primarily by other applicable terms and policies (collectively,  the  Service Terms  and  Policies),  which  will  be  made  available  on  the insChain

    Platform and/or Website, if the services and insChain Platform is successfully completed and deployed. We may update these Terms or the Service Terms and Policies in our sole and absolute discretion. It shall be your responsibility to regularly check the insChain Platform / Website for any such notices.

    To the extent of any conflict with these Terms, the updated Terms and the Service Terms and Policies which may be published from time to time on the insChain Platform shall prevail with respect to any issues relating to the usage of GETX in connection with the insChain Platform.

    We reserve the right to require you to provide us with your personal details (including without limitation correct name, address and details of the digital wallet from which you have sent the funds), and it is your responsibility to provide correct details. Failure to provide this information will prevent us from transferring GETX to your digital wallet.

• CANCELLATION AND REFUSAL AT SELLER'S DISCRETION

    You shall be deemed to have made an offer to purchase GETX from us on these Terms upon our safe receipt (i.e. confirmed by the relevant blockchain / network and freely made available for transfer by us) of the relevant virtual currency transferred to the correct digital wallet address (as notified to you or otherwise published by us), and we reserve the right to refuse, cancel or accept any offers to purchase GETX (without giving reasons) at any time in our sole discretion (including without limitation in connection with any failure to complete know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing checks prescribed by us).

    Your purchase of GETX (whether through an intermediary or otherwise) from the Seller is final, and you waive any rights to be refunded any amounts which you have paid to us in exchange for GETX or to cancel any purchase (whether through an intermediary or otherwise) of GETX, Provided Always that in the event of an adverse change of the regulatory environment, we shall (at our sole discretion) be entitled to cancel all issued GETX and repay the price (in the same currency or virtual currency, as the case may be) that you pay for GETX (less fees and expenses incurred in connection with the development of the insChain Platform).

• ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF RISKS

    You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing GETX, holding GETX, and using GETX for participation in the insChain Platform. If you have any queries or require any clarification regarding these risks, please contact us at legal@inschain.io.

    YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT BLOCKCHAIN AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES / TOKENS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ETHEREUM, BITCOIN, NEO and QTUM, ARE NEW AND UNVERIFIED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEYOND CONTROL OF ANY GROUP ENTITY. IN PARTICULAR, AND IN ADDITION TO TERMS OF THIS DOCUMENT, YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RISKS DESIGNATED IN THE PROPOSED DOCUMENTATION. BY PURCHASING (WHETHER THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY OR OTHERWISE), HOLDING AND/OR USING GETX, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

• Security

    You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing the digital wallet, vault or other storage mechanism you use to receive and hold GETX which you have purchased, including any requisite passwords, tokens, private key(s) or other credentials necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If your passwords, tokens, private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your GETX. We cannot be responsible for, and are technologically unable to recover, any such losses.

• Risks associated with the Blockchain Protocol

    Given that GETX and the insChain Platform are based on blockchain protocol and architecture, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the relevant blockchain protocol or architecture may have a material adverse effect on GETX and/or the insChain Platform. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to GETX and/or the insChain Platform by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.

• Insufficient Information

    The insChain Platform is at the stage of development as of the date of these Terms and its algorithm, code, consensus mechanism and/or various other technical specifications and parameters could be updated and changed frequently and constantly. While the marketing materials and Whitepaper released relating to the development of the insChain Platform has been prepared with the then up-to-date key information of the insChain Platform, it is not absolutely complete and is subject to adjustments and updates from time to time for optimal development and growth of the insChain Platform and/or ecosystem on the insChain Platform. We are unable, nor obliged, to keep you closely posted on every detail of the development of the insChain Platform (including its progress and expected milestones no matter whether rescheduled or not) and therefore will not necessarily provide you with timely and full access to all the information relating to the insChain Platform that may emerge from time to time. Due to the nature of the project to develop the insChain Platform, you accept that such insufficiency of information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

• Security weaknesses.

    Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with GETX and/or the insChain Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of any Group Entity may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of GETX and/or the insChain Platform, which could negatively affect GETX and/or the insChain Platform.

• Risks associated with markets for GETX

    There is no prior market for GETX and the GETX token sale may not result in an active or liquid market for GETX. GETX is intended to be used solely within the network for the insChain Platform, hence there may be illiquidity risk with respect to any GETX you hold.

    GETX is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasinational organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit nor is it a "commodity" in the usual and traditional sense of that word. We are not responsible for, nor do we pursue, the circulation and trading of GETX on any market. Trading of GETX will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant market participants. No one is obliged to purchase any GETX from any holder of GETX, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of GETX to any extent at any time. Furthermore, GETX may not be resold to a purchaser who is a citizen, national, resident (tax or otherwise), domiciliary or green card holder of a Restricted Country or to purchasers where the purchase of GETX may be in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the we cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for GETX, or that the price you pay for GETX is indicative of any market valuation or market price for GETX.

    Any secondary market or exchange for trading GETX would be run and operated wholly independently of the Group Entities, the sale of GETX and the insChain Platform. No Group Entity will create such secondary markets nor will it act as an exchange for GETX. Even if secondary trading of GETX is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to GETX (e.g., as denominated in a virtual or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile, decline below the price which you have paid for GETX, and/or diminish to zero.

• Risk of Uninsured Losses

    GETX is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.

• Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

    The regulatory status of GETX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including GETX and/or the insChain Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact GETX and/or the insChain Platform in various ways. The Seller or any Group Entity may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

• Taxation risks

    The tax characterisation of GETX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with the purchase, holding and/or usage of GETX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.

• Competitors

    It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying GETX and/or the insChain Platform and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The insChain Platform may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact GETX and/or the insChain Platform.

• Insufficient Interest

    It is possible that the insChain Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the insChain Platform). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the insChain Platform and therefore the potential utility of GETX.

• Risk of Dissolution of the Seller, any Group Entity or the insChain Platform

    Start-up companies such as the Seller involve a high degree of risk. Financial and operating risks confronting start-up companies are significant, and the Seller is not immune to these. Start-up companies often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.

    It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, decrease in the utility of GETX due to negative adoption of the insChain Platform, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the insChain Platform may no longer be viable to operate and the Seller or any Group Entity may be dissolved.

• Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights

    Because GETX confers no governance rights of any kind with respect to the insChain Platform or any Group Entity, all decisions involving the insChain Platform or any Group Entity will be made by the relevant Group Entity at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the services and/or ecosystem on the insChain Platform, to create and sell more GETX for use in the ecosystem on the insChain Platform, or to sell or liquidate any Group Entity. These decisions could adversely affect the insChain Platform and GETX you hold.

    • Loss of Talent

        The development of the insChain Platform depends on the continued cooperation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the insChain Platform or its future development.

    • Failure to develop

        There is the risk that the development of the insChain Platform will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or GETX, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

    • Risks Involving Cloud Storage

        As the insChain Platform may provide a decentralised cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the insChain Platform (and services thereon) are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The insChain Platform (and services thereon) may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the insChain Platform and/or services thereon may be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the insChain Platform, there is the risk that the insChain Platform and/or services thereon may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Group Entities do not control. The risk that the insChain Platform and/or services thereon may face increasing interruptions and the ecosystem on the insChain Platform may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the insChain Platform and ecosystem thereon, and therefore the future utility of any GETX that you hold.

    • Other risks

        In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and usage of GETX, including those that the Seller cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks.

• KNOW YOUR CLIENT REGULATIONS AND PERSONAL DATA

    Know your client regulations

    You hereby acknowledge and accept that:

    • The Seller may be required to conduct customer identification, due diligence and anti-money laundering due diligence on all purchasers of GETX in compliance with all applicable laws and legislations. We may determine, in our sole discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with these laws and legislations. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request, and you acknowledge that we may refuse to sell GETX to you until you provide such requested information and we have determined that it is permissible to sell you GETX under applicable law or regulation.

• We may at any point in time request information and/or documentation to establish that our identification records, as well as the information that form your profile, remain completely updated. In this respect, we reserve the right to examine and check on a regular basis the validity and adequacy of your identification data and information we maintain.

• If at any time we become aware that reliable or adequate data and information are missing from your identity, we reserve the right to take all necessary actions to collect the missing data and information (whether from you or from third parties) so as to update and complete your profile as necessary.

• If you fail or refuse to submit, within a reasonable timeframe, the required data and identification information for the updating of your identity and, as a consequence, we are unable to comply with any laws, legislations regulations or directives relating to customer identification requirements, the Seller will not be able to sell GETX and/or continue its relationship with you, and we may be required to submit a report of suspicious transactions/activities to the relevant authorities.
